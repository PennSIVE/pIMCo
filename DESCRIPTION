Description: Takes inputs of two or more pre-processed MRI images from the same subject along with mask to apply, if desired. For each voxel in the image/mask, calculates strength of coupling (scaled first eigenvalue) based on Gaussian-weighted local neighborhood. Returns output of one coupled antsImage.
